# End of unit assessment

For much of western history, artists created what is known as representational art. Pictures of peoples, places, and things that told a story. However, in the early 1900's a growing number of artists explored making non-representational art, including Piete Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky, and Jackson Pollock.
>As a catalyst for contemporary art, abstract painting rejected the “rules” of traditional art. Rather than focus on figurative and representational depictions, abstract painters placed emphasis on color, composition, and emotion. Similarly, instead of concentrating solely on the completed works, these artists placed importance in the process.

Your assignment is to read through [this article](https://mymodernmet.com/abstract-artists/) from My Modern Met and learn more about the artists and choose one artist whose style you admire. Don't forget to check out page 2 for more artists. Based on their work, create an original sketch in p5.js that mimics the style of that artist. Consider their use of color, shapes, composition, and texture. In addition to submitting a link to a sketch also submit 2 - 3 paragraphs about the artist you chose and how you used their work as inspiration for your own work.

For this assignment you will have to explore other built in drawing functions in p5.js including [colors](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Color) and [shape](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape) The complete p5.js reference can be found [here](https://p5js.org/reference)
