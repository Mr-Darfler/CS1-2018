## Daniel Shiffman
Throughout this course we will be drawing heavily from Daniel Shiffman's _Introduction to Programming with p5.js_ tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA). They are very well considered and he's a pretty funny guy. To get us started, here's the first video in the series

### Try it out yourself.
Using the code below, see if you can change the size of the rectangle to be centered in the window and be twice as big.

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-width="350" data-preview-width="250">
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
  background(150);
}
function draw(){
  rect(50,50,20,20)
}
</script>
