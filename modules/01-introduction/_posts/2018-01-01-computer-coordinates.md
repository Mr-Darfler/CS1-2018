# Coordinate Systems in computers
In this unit we will look at different coordinate systems and explain their similarities and differences.

## The Cartesian coordinate system
Hopefully you are familiar with the standard cartesian coordinate system from geometry class. Two major axises cross at right angles. Each axis is essentially a number line going from -∞ to ∞ and crossing at their respective zeros. In this way we can define any point on this infinite plane as the combination of two values, one in the x direction (horizontal) and one in the y direction (vertical) [![](https://mathinsight.org/media/image/image/cartesian_axes_2d_point.png)](https://mathinsight.org/cartesian_coordinates)
