## Daniel Shiffman
Throughout this course we will be drawing heavily from Daniel Shiffman's _Introduction to Programming with p5.js_ tutorials on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA).

### Try it out yourself.
Using the code below, see if you can change the size of the rectangle to be centered in the window and be twice as big.

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-width="200" data-preview-width="200">
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 100);
  background(255, 0, 200);
}
</script>
