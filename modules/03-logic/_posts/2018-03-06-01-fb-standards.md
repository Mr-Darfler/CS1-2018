# {{page.title}} - Facebook Community Standards
In April of 2018, Facebook released its internal [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/) with the goal to "encourage expression and create a safe environment." The Standards are based on the policies of Safety, Voice, and Equality and outline 6 broad areas of objectionable content with 23 subcategories and numerous sub-sub categories. As is befitting of a tech company, the "Standards apply around the world to all types of content. Theyâ€™re designed to be comprehensive."

  - How might this decision on the part of Facebook adversely effect the fair enforcement of their standards?
  - In what ways could the review process be modified in order to improve the fair enforcement of standards?
