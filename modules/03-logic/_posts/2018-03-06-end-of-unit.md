# {{page.title}} - Defining Hate Speech
In April of 2018, Facebook released its internal [Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/) with the goal to "encourage expression and create a safe environment." The Standards are based on the policies of Safety, Voice, and Equality and outline 6 broad areas of objectionable content with 23 subcategories and numerous sub-sub categories. As is befitting of a tech company, the "Standards apply around the world to all types of content. Theyâ€™re designed to be comprehensive."

## Setting the Stage.

Please read this article from NPR entitled [Facebook Updates Community Standards, Expands Appeals Process](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/24/605107093/facebook-updates-community-standards-expands-appeals-process)

Answer the following question:
- Why do you think Facebook decided to publish their internal standards?
- How do the current standards differ from the previous community standards?
- The author mentions that much of the decision making on what constitutes a violation of the community standards is done by "subcontractors who are stationed in distant countries and asked to review large quantities of posts every shift."
  - How might this decision on the part of Facebook adversely effect the fair enforcement of their standards?
  - In what ways could the review process be modified in order to improve the fair enforcement of standards?
