# {{page.title}}

Data types are a way of categorizing different types of variables inside of a computer program. JavaScript is what is referred to as a weakly typed programming language. What this means is that when declaring a variable you don’t have to declare what type of variable it is. This is great for you because you don’t have to worry too much about managing all of this because it all happens in the background. That said it’s still a good idea to understand what a data type is.

## How computers store variables.
You've probably heard the term "binary" before in relation to computers. What this means is that computers store information as either 0's or 1's. For the most part we use the decimal numbers 0 - 9 to store numbers. So how does a computer store the number 9? We'll look at this more in depth later, but for now, let's just say that the computer converts this number to the binary value (1001) and then stores it in memory.
- Any whole number (1, 42, -1925, etc.) is called an integer or an `int`.
- If the number has a decimal associated with it (1.294, 3.1416, -283.1129) it is called a floating point number or a `float`.
- We may also want to store things other than numbers such as a character `char`,
- strings `str` (a collection of `char`s)
- or even whole objects, which we'll look at later.

## Video Explanation
This video talks about how data types are used in writing code for an Arduino, which is a small micro controller. We'll look at what this is later but for now this is a good Explanation
