So far, we've only declared our variables at the top of the program. While this is sufficient for now, we may want to be more specific about where are variable can be accessed from.

## Global Variables

When we declare a variable at the top of our program, we are, in fact, making a global variable. This means that we can use this variable anywhere in our program.

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-width="300" data-preview-width="260" data-height="200">

var x = 100;

function setup(){
  createCanvas(x,200);
}

function draw(){
  rect(x/10,20,x/5,40)
}
</script>

## Local Variables

While global variables are great, sometimes we only need to use the variable in one particular code block (the stuff inside of `{}`). Local variables are declared in exactly the same way, except instead of declaring them at the start of the program, we declare them _inside_ of the code block.

  <script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-width="300" data-preview-width="260" data-height="200">
  function setup(){
    var x = 100;
    createCanvas(x,2*x);
  }

  function draw(){
    rect(x/10,20,x/5,40)
  }
  </script>
