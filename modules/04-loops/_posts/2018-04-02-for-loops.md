This lesson will look at a special type of while loop called a `for` loop.

## Initialize, test, increment
Looking back at the previous lesson, we created a `while` loop that made a bunch of equally spaced circles on a canvas.
```
function setup(){
  createCanvas(260,260);
  background(220);

  var y = width/2;
  var d = 35;
  var spacing = 60;

  var x = 20;
  while(x < width){
    ellipse(x,y,d,d);
    x += spacing;
  }
}
```
Let's take a second to examine the structure that we used. First, we `initialized` a variable, in this case `x`. Next we started our loop by `testing` if the boolean expression was true or false. then we ran some code and before we finished the loop we `incremented` our variable that we initialized at the start.

```
var x = 20;             //initialize
while(x < width){       //test
    ellipse(x,y,d,d);
    x += spacing;       //increment
}  
```
This is such a common type of loop that they made a special loop, called a `for` loop, just for this case.

## How to write a `for` loop.

The way that a `for` loop works is that it combines all three of those steps from above—`initialize, test, increment`—inside of the parentheses `()`. to make things easy to understand, each step is separated by a `;` So in general we'll have
```
for(initialize, test, increment){
  //do this
}
```
For our code above we can rewrite our for loop as:
```
for(var x = 20; x < width; x += spacing){
  ellipse(x, y, d, d);
}
```
This code operates **exactly** the same way as the while loop that we wrote in the last lesson.

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-width="300" data-preview-width="260" data-height="400">
function setup(){
  createCanvas(260,260);
  background(220);

  var y = width/3;
  var d = 35;
  var spacing = 60;

  fill(0,0,255);
  var x = 20;
  while(x < width){
    ellipse(x,y,d,d);
    x += spacing;
  }

  fill(255,0,0);
  var y = 2*(width/3);
  for(var x = 20; x < width; x+=spacing){
    ellipse(x,y,d,d);
  }
}
</script>
