## [Rotate](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rotate)
Rotates a shape the amount specified by the angle parameter. This function accounts for `angleMode`, so angles can be entered in either `RADIANS` or `DEGREES`.

Objects are always rotated around their _relative position to the origin_ and positive numbers rotate objects in a **clockwise** direction. Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent calls to the function accumulates the effect. For example, calling `rotate(HALF_PI)` and then `rotate(HALF_PI)` is the same as `rotate(PI)`. All transformations are reset when draw() begins again.

### Degrees and Radians
A quick aside: when talking about rotation we  are talking about moving around a circle. There are two systems of measurement that we can use - Degrees and Radians. In the image below, you can see how these two are related. For degrees, the measurements go from 0 - 360. In radians, the measurements go from 0 - 2π.

**TAKE NOTE** In the image above, the radians/degrees increase as you rotate **counterclockwise.** As with all drawing in p5.js, the _y-axis_ is mirrored across the _x-axis_. This means that when we are drawing, increasing the radians/degrees rotates you in the **clockwise** direction. e.g. a rotation of π/90º will put you at the bottom of the circle.

By default, p5.js uses radians. You can change this with the command `angleMode(MODE)` where MODE can be either `DEGREES` or `RADIANS`. You can also use negative angles to go counterclockwise around the circle. e.g. -π/4 == 7π/4. -90º == 270º

### Relative position to the origin
In p5.js, by default the origin is at _(0,0)._ We'll see how to change that in just a bit, but for now let's see what we can do. Let's say we want to make a arch of circles. How might we do that? We'll need to:
1. set an angle or rotation
2. draw our ellipse
3. increase our angle of rotation
4. repeat

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-width="260" data-preview-width="300" data-height="400">
var rot = 0; //rotation variable
function setup(){
  createCanvas(260,260);
  background(220);
  frameRate(5);
}

function draw(){
  rotate(rot); // set rotation
  line(0,0,200,0); //for illustration
  ellipse(200,0,20,20); //draw circle
  rot += PI/16; //increase rotation
  if(rot >= 2 * PI)){
    background(220);
    rot = 0;
  }
}
</script>

This is good, but what if we want to change the origin?
