# Welcome to _Introduction to Computer Science_

**Huzzah!** If you've reached the page that means you're probably taking Introduction to Computer Science at Friends' Central School during the first semester of the 2018/2019 school year. Although, perhaps you're just a curious individual who is looking to learn more about programming. In either case, welcome.

## How to use this site

The main intent for this website is to provide a set of learning modules that will take you through some basic programming using [p5.js](http://www.p5js.org). p5 is based on [Processing](http://www.processing.org), a Java IDE designed for artists and creative types. p5.js is a JavaScript library that makes drawing, interaction, and audio easy to do, online.

=======

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay>
function setup() {
  createCanvas(100, 100);
}

function draw() {
  background(255, 0, 200);
}
</script>

By default, your course will be hosted on [Github](https://www.github.com), a popular development platform that allows for collaborative drafting, version control, and easy dissemination of your course. Best of all, hosting a course on Github is **free**!

So what does it look like? Recently, Creative Commons and the Open University used in Course in a Box to create [a course about Open Educational Resources](http://www.exploerercourse.org/). The Children’s Museum in Pittsburgh created [a course about designing maker spaces in libraries and museums](http://p2pu.github.io/makingandlearning/).

Using Course in a Box is completely free. However, if you’d like to hire us to help you set things up and give feedback along the way, we are available to do that too. Just reach out to us a thepeople[at]p2pu[dot]org.
